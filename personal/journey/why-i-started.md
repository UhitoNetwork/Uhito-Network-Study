# Why I Started Learning

It began with stories. I started writing short hacker stories – all from my imagination. I wrote one, then another, then many. The characters felt real, but I didn't know if their methods were real.

I needed facts. So I began asking myself:
- Who is the hacker?
- What do they actually do?
- Where do they operate?
- What drives them?

To answer those questions, I had to understand threats. I started taking cybersecurity certificates – not for a job, but to understand the enemy. To learn how to stop them.
