# Ethics Kept

I learned hacking techniques. I know how attacks work – step by step.

But I keep my ethics. I never used those skills to harm anyone. Knowledge is not a crime; intent is.

My intent is protection. I study attackers so I can stop them. I learn their tools so I can build defenses. I keep my ethics because once you cross that line, it's hard to come back.
