# 560 Days Journey at 13/02/2026

**Time spent:** 560 days  
**Cash spent:** $0  
**Method:** Financial aid, free courses, self‑study

I started with imagination. Now I have knowledge.  
I started alone. Now I build for community.

560 days of:
- Rejections (certificates don't guarantee jobs)
- Confusion (hitting walls, skipping, circling back)
- Discovery (finding what really matters)
- Documentation (saving everything)

But I never stopped. This repo is the proof.

If I can do it with zero money, anyone can. You just need the will and the right free resources.
