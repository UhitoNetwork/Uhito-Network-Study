# Mentorship & Getting Involved

## How to Find Mentors
- Join Discord servers of the YouTube channels listed in `resources.md`
- Participate in CTF teams (find teammates on CTFtime)
- Contribute to open-source security tools (GitHub)
- Attend local security meetups (OWASP chapters, DEFCON groups)

## How to Volunteer (like I did)
- Offer to fix computers for friends/family – teach them security
- Help small businesses with basic security (password policies, backups)
- Create awareness content in your own language (simple words, not tech jargon)
- Document everything – it becomes your proof of work

## Our Volunteer Program
Uhito Network welcomes anyone who wants to help their community.  
If you've used these resources and want to give back:

1. Start by protecting yourself (learn from this repo)
2. Help one person understand one simple rule (e.g., "don't reuse passwords")
3. Document that help (screenshot, note, testimonial)
4. Email us: **uhitonetwork@gmail.com** – tell us what you did

We'll guide you on next steps.
