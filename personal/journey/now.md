# Now – February 2026

Today I am still learning. Still researching. Still documenting.

I am building the Uhito Network – four pillars: Research, Study, Awareness, Volunteer. I share what I learn so others can walk a safer path. I help people protect their information in simple language everyone understands.

I am not done. The journey that started on September 19, 2021 continues. Every day brings new questions, new threats, new ways to help.

If you're reading this and wondering if you can do it too – you can. Start with curiosity. Keep your ethics. Document everything. And never stop.
