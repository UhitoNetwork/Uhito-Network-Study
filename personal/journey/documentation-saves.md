# Documentation Saves Me

Without documentation, you can get lost.

560 days of learning – courses, notes, failures, insights. If I didn't write it down, I would forget half of it.

This repository is my memory. Every file, every link, every mistake is saved. It's proof that I didn't just collect certificates – I learned.

Documentation also protects me. If someone questions my knowledge, I can point to the work. If government needs proof, it's here. Documentation is my shield.
