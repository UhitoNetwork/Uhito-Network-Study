# What I Skipped

Courses are full of additional information. If I didn't need it for my goal, I skipped it.

Not out of disrespect – out of focus. I don't need to know everything. I need to know what solves the problem: hackers and unprotected people.

So I skipped:
- Deep dives into legacy systems
- History of computing (interesting, but not urgent)
- Marketing and business modules in some courses

I kept my eyes on the target. If it doesn't help me protect someone or understand an attacker, I leave it for later – or forever.
