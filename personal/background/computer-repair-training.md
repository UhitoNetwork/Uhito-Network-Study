# Computer Repair Training – Real-World Learning

I still do volunteer training at a local repair shop. The owner allows me to work on customer devices – desktops, laptops, sometimes old servers.

I learned:
- How to diagnose hardware failures (RAM, hard drives, power supplies)
- How to wipe drives securely (DBAN, diskpart clean)
- How to install and update operating systems
- How to explain technical problems to non‑tech people

One day, I saw old hard drives thrown in the trash – still full of personal data. Bank statements, photos, passwords. The owner didn't even think about it. I told him: we should wipe them before disposal. He agreed. Now we do.

That moment opened my eyes. People lose data not because hackers are smart, but because nobody warned them.
