# C# UI Projects – My Early Tech Background

Before cybersecurity, I was building things.

I followed UI Academy C# on YouTube. I created library frameworks – custom buttons, controls, and design elements for Visual Studio. I loved making interfaces look good and work smoothly.

That experience taught me how software is constructed. Later, when I started learning about security, it helped me understand how vulnerabilities can hide inside seemingly harmless code.

I wasn't thinking about security back then. I just wanted to create. But that foundation made it easier to grasp how systems are built – and how they can be broken.
