# The Start – September 19, 2021

It began with stories.

I started writing short hacker stories – all from my imagination. I wrote one, then another, then many. The characters felt real, but I didn't know if their methods were real.

I needed facts. So I began asking myself:

- Who is the hacker?
- What do they actually do?
- Where do they operate?
- What drives them?

To answer those questions, I had to understand threats. I started taking cybersecurity certificates – not for a job, but to understand the enemy. To learn how to stop them.

That question – *“What drives them?”* – became the seed of everything. It led me to study not just technology, but the human behind the screen. And it eventually grew into the Uhito Network.

This journey started on September 19, 2021. It has never stopped.
