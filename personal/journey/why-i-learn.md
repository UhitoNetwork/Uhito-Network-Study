# Why I Learn – Understanding the Enemy to Protect

I learn because I want to fix.

I saw too many young minds drift into the dark – chasing thrill or quick money, unaware of the wreckage they'd leave behind, including their own futures. I wanted to understand that path so I could show another way.

I learn to understand the attacker, so I can build defenses. I learn to see the lines people cross, so I can draw them clearly for others. I learn because knowledge is the strongest shield – both for myself and for those I want to protect.

This is the core of my research: to know the enemy, to predict their moves, and to stop them before they cause harm. I don't learn for certificates. I don't learn for a job. I learn to serve.
