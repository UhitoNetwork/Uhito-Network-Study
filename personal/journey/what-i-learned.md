# What I Learned – Threats and Defenses

Through courses and self‑study, I learned the names of threats:

- Phishing, spear phishing, whaling
- Ransomware, trojans, worms, rootkits
- DDoS, MITM, SQL injection, XSS
- Botnets, keyloggers, stealers, RATs

I learned how to stop them:

- Firewalls, EDR, SIEM, MFA, least privilege
- Patching, hardening, segmentation, backups
- Awareness training

But the most important lesson was this: technical knowledge alone is not enough. You must understand the human behind the screen – both the attacker and the victim.
