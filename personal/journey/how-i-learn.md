# How I Learn – From Unofficial to Official

I started with YouTube – free, visual, community‑driven. I moved through tech forums, random websites, and shared knowledge from strangers online. That was my unofficial foundation.

Then I realized I needed structure. I began using certification curricula as roadmaps – but I never paid for exams. I used financial aid, free courses, and open materials to follow those paths. This is how I moved from unofficial learning to official knowledge, without spending money.

My method is simple:

- Find a topic (threat, tool, concept).
- Gather free resources.
- Take notes obsessively.
- Practice in my own lab.
- Document everything.

No expensive bootcamps. No debt. Just curiosity and consistency.
