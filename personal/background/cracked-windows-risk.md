# Cracked Windows – The Hidden Risk

For many people, using a cracked version of Windows means free software. No cost, no activation – what's the harm?

I used to think the same. But I didn't know about botnets, backdoors, and remote access tools hidden inside those "free" activators. Someone else could be watching my screen, stealing my files, or using my computer to attack others.

Without cybersecurity courses, I was just a dump. I clicked anything, installed anything, and believed antivirus was enough.

Now I know better. Free can be very expensive.
